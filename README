	    The Running Time of the Towers of Hanoi Puzzle

This repository is dedicated to maintaining my proof/solution to an
open problem in computer science.  The open problem in question is:
``How long does it take to solve the Towers of Hanoi puzzle as the
number of towers increases?''

In order to compile the output, you need to have access to `python3'
and `gnuplot' (aside from standard compilation programs such as `tex'
and `cc').  Also, you should preferably have `make' installed.
